# Cool Name RPG Playtest Players Guide

Welcome to the Cool Name RPG Playtest.  This players guide will assist you in understanding how this game is played.  So without further ado, lets begin!

> **Terminology**
> **Check:** Anytime you need to roll dice or compare scores to determine if an action succeeds or fails, we call it a check. 
> **Score:** A numeric value assigned to an ability, item, situation, or anything else that can impact the outcome of a check.
> **Action Score (AS):** The totaled scores for everything working in your character’s favor.
> **Action Table:** The table where you find your Action Score to determine which dice to roll.
> **Action Score Result (ASR)**:  The result after the dice have been rolled and totaled.
> **Difficulty Score(DS):** The totaled scores for everything working against your character.

# Game Mechanics
To resolve **checks** in CNRPG, use the steps listed below:
1. The GM will set the difficulty score (anything that works against your characters favour)
2. Set the Action Score, add the scores up that work in the characters favour
3. Roll the dice.  Consult the Action Score Table which will tell you which dice to roll.  *Note: Dice are open ended.*
4. Determine the result.  After the dice have been rolled, add them together to determine the Action Score Result.
5. Compare - If the ASR is equal to or greater than the DS, you have succeeded at the check. 

>Open Ended Dice Rolls
>When you roll the dice, if its maximum value on the dice, roll it again and add it to the total.

## Setting Your Action Score
Action Scores are calculated in the following manner:
**Attribute  + Modus Operandi  + Focus  + Specialisation + Misc. Modifiers = Action Score**

| |Attribute|MO|Focus|Specialisation|Misc|AS|Dice|
|-|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|Athletics|2|3|1|0|0|6|d6+d6|

* Attribute Score - The appropriate attribute for the check
* Modus Operandi Score - Does you MO apply to this check?
* Focus Score - Do you have a focus that would apply?
* Specialisation - Do you have a specialisation that would apply?
* Misc. Modifier is anything that helps the character succeed at the check that they are making.
* Action Score - the score after you add AS, MO, ASM.
* Dice -  Compare the AS on the table to determine what dice to roll.

## Action Score Dice Table

| Action Score | Dice    |
|:--------------:|:---------:|
| 2            | d6      |
| 3            | d8      |

# Character Statistics
## Attributes 
Attributes are broken up into 3 categories: Physical, Mental, Instinctive.

### Physical
#### Strength
This is the character’s ability to lift, carry, pull, push, and cause damage with melee attacks. Strength also reflects the character’s overall muscle mass and physical power.

#### Coordination
The character’s motor skills, sense of balance, agility, and accuracy with ranged weapons are determined by their coordination. It is used for full-body activities such as acrobatics as well as actions requiring hand-eye-coordination, such as pick pocketing.

#### Toughness
Toughness is the ability to function and recover when faced with illness, accidents, or other physical demands. It helps to determine the character’s ability to survive physical injury and resist fatigue.

### Mental
Mind is a representation of the character’s willpower, intellect, and creativity. It impacts the character’s ability to solve problems, recall information, and resist mental manipulation.
#### Creativity
Creativity represents the character’s ability to assemble information in new and novel ways. It is core attribute for artistic creation, thinking “outside of the box,” and finding solving problems where the answer lies outside the realm of accepted truths.
#### Intellect
A character’s logical processing, ability to identify patterns, and general memory are all aspects of their intellect. Intellect is the key attribute for action checks involving logical deduction, learning complex tasks, and remembering facts.
#### Willpower
Willower is the character’s ability to resist the influence of others and persevere in the face of extreme hardship. Willpower is important for resisting fear, combating psychic assault, and seeing through illusions
### Instinctive 
Spirit reflects the character’s empathy, presence, and awareness. It also represents the character’s inherent wisdom, force of personality, ability to quickly process sensory information, and retain their composure in stressful situations. 
#### Awareness
A character’s Awareness is their ability to notice key details in their surroundings. Awareness comes into play when trying to finding hidden objects, spotting unusual features of a place or object, and seeing through deception.
#### Empathy
A character’s Empathy represents how in touch they are with other living creatures and, in some settings, the natural world. Empathy might come into play when trying to bond with or train an animal, engender trust in a person or group, or recognizing a person’s true intentions and nature
#### Presence
Presence represents a character’s force of personality. The skills it applies to are learned, but the attribute represents the character’s natural “stage presence.” Action checks for performance, intimidation, seduction, and leadership are all examples of action checks influenced by the character’s presence. Note that presence is not necessarily “charisma.” A hideous monster is just as likely to have a high presence as a dashing rogue


**Typical Attribute Scores**

| Score | Example             |
| ----- |:------------------- |
| 1     | Children, Elderly   |
| 2     | Average Person      |
| 3     | Notably better      |
| 4     | Exceptional ability |
| 5     | World Class         |

**Starting Attributes**
For our playtest, if you want to make your own character, you will begin with the following attribute scores: **2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4**. Assign one of these numbers to each of your attributes.

## Secondary Attributes
Characters have a number of secondary attributes that will come into play during the game, especially during combat. 
### Vitality
A character’s Vitality score represents how long they can stay on their feet and keep fighting. It is a combination of the character’s overall health, their resistance to stunning blows, and their ability to resist fatigue. Whenever the character strains themselves, takes a hit, or otherwise suffers physical injury, it reduces their current Vitality. When a character’s current Vitality reaches zero, the character is Incapacitated and can't take any major actions during combat. Maximum Vitality score is the total of all the character’s physical attribute scores. **Strength score + Toughness score + Coordination score = Maximum Vitality score**
### Wound Threshold
A character’s Wound Threshold is equal to their **Toughness score**. Whenever a character takes damage equal to or greater than their Wound Threshold in a single hit, they get a wound. Each untreated wound adds +1 to the DS for all action checks. (See Vitality, Wounds, and Healing in the Combat section for more information.)
### Initiative
Initiative represents the characters awareness and reflex before combat begins and determines the order in which players take their turn when combat starts.  Initiative is equal to their **Coordination score + Awareness score**.
## Modus Operandi

Each character has one or more Modus Operandi (MOs). Each MO represents a collection of skills, talents, and abilities the character picked-up during their career as an adventurer. When faced with a challenge, it is up to you and the GM to determine if your MO score applies to the situation at hand. MOs have scores, just like attributes. For this playtest, the scores for your character’s MOs will range from 1 to 3. When resolving a check where your MO applies, add your MO score to your Attribute score to determine your Action Score.  

**Starting MOs**

You have 3 points to assign to MOs when creating a playtest character. You can either have:
* One MO with a score of 3.
* One MO with a score of 2 and a second MO with a score of 1.

The first MO you choose will be the Primary MO.  This is the MO from which you gain your **Special Feature** 

## Focus & Specialisation
Your MO represents a broad collection of skills, talents, and abilities your character has mastered, but it’s possible to spend extra time perfecting one’s skills in a particular area. In Cool Name RPG, we represent this with Focuses and Specializations. 
#### Focuses (Foci??) 
A focus represents extra time spent by the character improving a single, broad area of study related to an MO. For instance, a warrior might have a focus in Melee Combat or a Thief might have a focus in Deception. 
##### Focuses and Action Checks 
Whenever your character performs an action check, it is up to the player and the GM to determine if one of the character’s focuses applies in that situation. If it does, the player may add the scores for both the Focus and the related MO to their Action Score for that action check.
##### Choosing Focuses 
The description of each MO lists the focuses a character can select for that MO. If you and the GM think of an equally logical focus of your own, however, you are welcome to add a focus not included on the list. 
##### Starting Focuses 
For the purpose of this playtest, your get 2 points to assign to focuses. You can distribute these in any way you like. You must have a minimum score of 1 in the parent MO to put points into a focus.

#### Specializations 
So your character has the Warrior MO with a focus in Melee, but what if you want the character to be a master of the sword? In other words, they can use most melee weapons, but they are at their finest when wielding a blade. In that case, you would want to add a specialization to your character’s focus. Specializations represent a further refinement of the character’s skills. Where a focus is a refinement of the MO, a specialization is a refinement of the focus. 
##### Specializations and Action Checks 
Whenever your character performs an action check, it is up to the player and the GM to determine if one of the character’s specializations apply in that situation. If it does, the player may add the scores for the Specialization, the Focus, and the related MO to their Action Score for that action check. 
##### Choosing Specializations 
The description of each MO lists the specializations a character can select for that MO. If you and the GM think of an equally logical specialization of your own, however, you are welcome to add a specialization not included on the list. 
##### Starting Specializations 
For the purpose of this playtest, your get 1 point to assign to a specialization. You must have a minimum score of 1 in the parent focus to put points into a specialization

## List of MOs
Below is a list of Modus Operandi that you can choose from.
### Cleric
Clerics are warrior priests. It is their duty to see that the will and rule of the gods are carried out and obeyed. They are religious specialists with extensive knowledge of their god and how that god is worshiped. They are also trained in the arts of combat, since their duties often take them into hostile territory or place them in situations where they are expected to defeat the enemies of their god. It is also likely that they can wield magic in some capacity, giving them access to spells
related to the powers and domains of their deity. Finally, they receive training in the healing arts, often serving as battlefield medics. 
**Special Feature:** Spiritual Persuasion
**Suggested Foci:** Spellcasting(Divine), Healing, Religion, Defence
### Merchant
Merchants are professional traders. Some travel from town to town while others sell their wares in permanent shops. They are expert hagglers, decent performers, and know how to quickly make friendly social connections with strangers. They are not warriors, but they know how to wield most light and simple weapons, since they may need to face off against bandits or thieves to defend their livelihood.
**Special Feature:** Silver Tongue
**Suggested Foci:** Persuasion, Deception, Performance, Professional

### Ranger
Rangers are warders of the forest, skilled in wilderness survival, overland navigation, and wood-lore. They have an affinity for the wild creatures of the world, and they love and respect nature. They are both hunter and protector of wild creatures, and are unmatched as trackers. Nature is nurturing, but also unforgiving and violent, so Rangers have mastered the use of bows, light weapons, and light armor.
**Special Feature:** Primal Affinity
**Suggested Foci:** Nature Lore, Hunt, Ranged, Endurance
### Sage
Sages are professional academics. They are the learned keepers of knowledge, versed in everything from history to  chemistry. The library is their home, but they have picked up a few survival skills in their occasional forays out into the world to obtain first-hand knowledge of their areas of interest. They are poor warriors, and while they know how to do many things, they often lack the practical skills to execute on their knowledge.
**Special Feature:** Know it all
**Suggested Foci:** Leadership, Alchemy, Science, Art
### Survivalist
A survivalist is at home in all the wild places of the world. Mountain or marsh, forest of fen, the survivalist knows where to find food, water, and shelter in any wild place. They are decent hunters and trappers, skilled in the preparation of herbal remedies, and are fair combatants 
**Special Feature:** Prepper
**Suggested Foci** Nature Lore, Journey, Camping, Hunt

### Thief
The thief’s goal in life is to get rich by taking wealth from others. Although it is a simple goal, it is also one rife with complications—specifically, the original owners of said wealth want to keep it. To get around this, thieves are experts at stealth, subterfuge, and infiltration. They have also learned to spot, disarm, and set traps as needed. Climbing, squeezing, and balancing also play a key role in their work. They can engage in direct combat if needed, but are more suited to hit and run actions.
**Special Feature:** Exploit Weakness
**Suggested Foci:** Deception, Larceny, Stealth, Security
### Warrior
Warriors are trained for one mission—to defeat the enemy in battle! They engage enemies head on, steel against steel. They are skilled in the use of all manner of melee and ranged weapons, from simple clubs to the finest blades to bows and crossbows. Warriors are also trained to survive in the field. They can make camp, forage for food, and set up simple defences. Field medicine is another of their talents, and to ensure their fitness for battle, they train in all manner of athletic activities.
**Special Feature:** Weapons Expert
**Suggested Foci:** Melee, Ranged, Defence, Unarmed
### Wizard
Masters of the arcane arts, wizards are powerful spellcasters and keepers of forbidden lore. They are privy to the metaphysical secrets of the universe and the magical forces at play in the world. They have knowledge of magical and magically altered beasts, basic skills in alchemy, and can sense the presence of magic and possibly identify its nature. 
**Special Feature:** Arcane Power
**Suggested Foci:** Spellcating(Arcane), Enchanting, Alchemy, Arcana

## Modus Operandi Special Features Rules Module

This rules module focuses on creating special features that you can attach to a particular Modus Operandi (MO). When a player chooses a MO for their character, they will also get this Special Feature. If however they choose multiple MO’s, the Primary MO will be the one to gain the related special feature.

>**Terminology**
>* ASR - Action Score Result
>* AS - Action Score
>* DS - Difficulty Score
>* MO - Modus Operandi Value
### Arcane Power
Your knowledge of the Arcane Arts allows you to tap into your innate Arcane power. Spellcasting focus is Arcane and you use Intellect as your casting attribute:

* Force missile - Deal damage equal to the difference between DS and ASR
* Dancing Lights - you have 4 small lights appear around you for the duration of combat, you can command these lights to hover where you like.
* Force Armor - gain +1 armour rating for the duration of combat.
### Spiritual Persuasion
You have a spiritual connection to a deity or local spirit and you're able to persuade them to grant you spells. The spellcasting focus is Divine and you use Presence as your casting attribute

* Heal - Restore health equal to the difference between DS and ASR
* Protective Ward - Gain +1 armour rating for the duration of combat
* Bless - For the duration of combat, you boost party morale. All party members in range gain +1 AS to the next skill check they make.

>**Spellcasting**
 You have either arcane gifts or a connection to a deity that grants you the ability to cast spells. When casting spells, you make a Magic action check (Casting Attribute + Modus Operandi + Focus). If you don't have any points in a Spellcasting focus, it will cost you a point in Vitality to attempt to cast a spell. Be warned though, failure to pass the check may result in a negative consequence rather than a positive one.
### Exploit Weakness
When you surprise a target or you're attacking the same target that's engaged with another player, add +1 to damage rolls
### Combat Ready
You excel in the art of combat, add +1 Action Score when attacking with a weapon. You also add your MO to your initiative.  
### Know It All
Your esoteric knowledge about a lot of subjects means you can convey this knowledge to other characters.  As an Action, you make a Difficulty Score 6 check (You action score is Intelligence + MO+ focus) to assist a character in a task. If you pass the check, you grant them a +1 to their Action Score.  But if you fail the roll, the Difficulty Score of the check increases by 1 instead.  
### Prepper
Add +1 to your AS when making checks to find food and shelter
### Primal Affinity
You can use your Instinctive Attributes to communicate with animals. This doesn’t mean you can talk to them but you can interpret their actions.
### Silver Tongue
You know how to get the best deal out of any situation, Add +1 AS when selling or buying goods.

## Combat 
This is the playtest rules for combat.
### Rounds & Turns
Cool Name RPG tracks time in combat using Rounds and Turns. Each Round of combat every participant in the combat gets one Turn to act. Combatants act in the order of their initiative scores, with the highest initiative score going first, the next highest second, and so forth.

### Movement
Each player will be able to move their character up to 30ft during their turn
### Actions per Round
For the purpose of this playtest, characters can take one major action, one movement, and one minor action per Round. Minor actions include changing position, drawing a blade, moving a short distance, or throwing open a door. Major actions include casting a spell, attacking an enemy, or retrieving something from your backpack. As a general rule, if it requires an action check, it’s a major action.  Movement actions are generally considered to be when the character moves around the battlefield.
### Initiative
At the start of the combat encounter, each player makes an Initiative check using their Initiative Score.  There is no DS for this check. The turn order goes in order of Highest to Lowest. 
### Armor
Reduces the amount of damage you take.
### Attacking the Enemy
To attack an enemy, the player makes a Coordination based action check for their character against a DS equal to the Defence score of the enemy. This is true for both ranged and melee attacks. 
#### MOs and Attack Action Scores 
No matter what MOs a player selects for their character, at the very least they know how to fight with fists, feet, daggers, bows, and clubs. Fantasy worlds are dangerous places, after all, and it is safe to assume everyone has learned a thing or two about self-defence. If the character is using one of the weapons listed above, they may add any one of the character’s MO to their Action Score when making attack action checks to attack an enemy. 
#### Focus & Specialisation
If you have the appropriate Focus & Specialisation for the weapon you are wielding, you can add this to your action check.

#### Attack Difficulty Score
Every monster and NPC will have a Defence Score.  This score serves as the DS for the action check when attacking that monster or NPC.

#### Damage
If the player hits, the amount of damage inflicted is equal to the difference between the number rolled & the Difficulty score.  For melee attacks and thrown weapons, its a this point you can also add your Strength Attribute to the damage.
#### Defending
When you are being attacked, make an action check, adding the appropriate Attribute, Focus & Specialisation.  You also add your MO to this check because it's assumed that all characters have some level of training in defending themselves.  If the ASR <= DS, you reduce your Vitality equal to the difference.  If you are wearing Armor, reduce the damage taken by this amount.  When defending you can defend using one of the following options:
* Dodge - The default defending option, you use your Coordination Attribute + MO + Defense Focus + Dodge specialisation.  You must also have 5ft free around you at the time.
* Block - Raise you shield, you can block the incoming attack.  Use your Toughness Attribute + MO + Defense Focus + Block Specialisation.
* Parry - Readying your weaponry, You can parry an incoming attack. Use your Strength attribute + MO + Defense Focus + Block specialisation.

### Vitality, Wounds & Healing
#### Vitality 
When a character’s Vitality reaches zero, they are incapacitated. They remain incapacitated until they regain at least one point of Vitality. While incapacitated,  the character cannot  make any major actions. It is not possible to have a negative current Vitality score. If a character takes damage while incapacitated, they automatically suffer a wound. If the damage is less than the character’s Toughness score, the wound has a severity of one. Otherwise, the wound’s severity is calculated normally (see Wounds below). 
#### Recovering Vitality 
There are a few ways to recover vitality. 
##### Recovery Action 
On their Turn, a character may take a Recovery action. When taking a Recovery action (which is considered a Major Action), the character makes a Toughness action check for their character with a DS equal to the total of the severity scores for untreated wounds. On a success, the character regains Vitality points equal to the amount they succeeded by, up to the character’s maximum vitality. 
##### First Aid 
If a character is unconscious, another character may perform an Intellect action check to perform first aid. The Base DS for this check is zero, but wounds and other effects may modify the DS. On a success, the character regains Vitality equal to the amount they succeeded by, up to the character’s maximum vitality. Modifiers may apply. No special conditions or materials are necessary for this action check, but especially dangerous, stressful, or bad conditions might increase the DS. 
##### Rest 
An hour of uninterrupted rest restores a character back to their maximum vitality.

#### Wounds 
Anytime the character takes damage equal to or greater than their **Toughness attribute**, they gain a wound. Each wound has a severity score. The severity is based on the number of times the wound exceeded your Toughness score.
##### Wound Effects 
Untreated wounds increase the DS for all action checks by the wound’s severity score. So if a character had an untreated Wound (2) and an untreated Wound (1), all of the DS’s for the character’s action checks are increased by +3. 
##### Treating Wounds 
A treated wound has no impact on the DS’s for the character’s action checks. To treat a wound, a character must perform first aid by making an Intellect action check. The Base DS for this action check is 3. The Base DS assumes the characters are in a safe location and have a well-stocked first aid or healing kit are requirements. The wound the character is treating, along with any other untreated wounds, modify the DS as described under Wound Effects. A dangerous environment, lack of the right medical equipment, and other detrimental effects will modify the DS as well. A character may treat their own wounds, but this adds +1 to the DS. Treated wounds only remain treated until the next morning. At that point the wound must be treated again or the character begins suffering the effects of the wound severity on their DS. 
##### Healing Wounds 
Healing wounds naturally is a slow process. The character must spend a full week resting in a safe, clean location, undertaking no more than light physical activity. At the end of each week, the character makes a Toughness action check with a DS equal to the total of the wound severities for all their wounds. On a success, the character reduces the severity of all their wounds by 1 point. Any wounds reduced to zero are considered fully healed and removed from the character’s character sheet.
#### Death and Dying 
A character cannot die from Vitality loss, but each time the character takes a wound they must make a Toughness action check. The DS of the action check is the severity of all the character’s current wounds, treated or untreated. On a successful check, the character survives the wound and has no additional effects. On a failure, the character collapses to the ground and is dying
##### Dying 
A dying character is unconscious with their life slowly ebbing away. The character will continue dying for a number of Rounds equal to their Toughness score. On the Round after that, the character dies.
##### Stabilization 
Another character can stabilize a dying character by making an Intellect action check against a DS equal to the total severity of all the character’s wounds, treated or untreated. On a success, the character being treated stops dying, but remains out cold for the remainder of the encounter. At the end of the encounter, they regain consciousness and may continue their adventure. A failure does not make things any worse, but the character keeps dying.
