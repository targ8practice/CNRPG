>You have either arcane gifts or a connection to a deity that grants you the ability to cast spells. When casting spells, you make a Magic action  check (Casting Attribute + Modus Operandi + Focus). If you don't have any points in a Spellcasting focus, it will cost you a point in Vitality to attempt to cast a spell. Be warned though, failure to pass the check may result in a negative consequence rather than a positive one.

### Exploit Weakness
When you surprise a target or you're attacking the same target that's engaged with another player, add +1 to damage rolls
### Combat Ready
You excel in the art of combat, add +1 Action Score when attacking with a weapon. You also add your MO to your initiative.  
### Know It All
Your esoteric knowledge about a lot of subjects means you can convey this knowledge to other characters.  As an Action, you make a Difficulty Score 6 check (You action score is Intelligence + MO+ focus) to assist a character in a task. If you pass the check, you grant them a +1 to their Action Score.  But if you fail the roll, the Difficulty Score of the check increases by 1 instead.  
### Prepper
Add +1 to your AS when making checks to find food and shelter
### Primal Affinity
You can use your Instinctive Attributes to communicate with animals. This doesn’t mean you can talk to them but you can interpret their actions.
### Silver Tongue
