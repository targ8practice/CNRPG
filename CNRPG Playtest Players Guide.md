## Combat

During combat, you can move or take an action.  When you attack, roll a Combat Skill Check against the Difficulty score.  The amount of damage you inflict is equal to the difference between the ASR and the DS.  If its a melee attack, you can also add your strength score to this result as well.

When you are being attacked, you can defend yourself by again making a Combat Skill Check against the difficulty score.  If the result is greater than the DS, you take no damage but if its less, you take that amount of damage and its also reduced by any armour that you're wearing
