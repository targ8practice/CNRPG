Players can either choose ONE of the following:
* Choose 1 core skill with access to all 3 Expanded skills
* Choose 2 core skills but only gain access to 3 Expanded skills (your choice)
Once players have chosen their Primary skill(s) they then assign score to them.

When creating your character, you are given the following scores: 4,3,3,2,2,2.  Assign them to all the Skills.  However the Primary skill you can then assign points to the Expanded skills equal to the core skill.
