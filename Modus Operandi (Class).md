Modus Operandi are created by selecting a Talent and a Primary Skill. All players have access to the Core skills but selecting a Core skill as a Primary Skill will allow you to put points into the expanded skills of that Primary skill

Players can either choose ONE of the following:
* Choose 1 core skill with access to all 3 Expanded skills
* Choose 2 core skills but only gain access to 3 Expanded skills (your choice)
Once players have chosen their Primary skill(s) they then assign score to them.
