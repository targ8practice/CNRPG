**WORKING TERMINOLOGY:** **Action Score**: The total of everything working the player's favour. **Difficulty Score**: The total of everything working against the player. **Action Chart**: The little table that shows what dice to roll for each score.

**PLAYER SIDE ROLLS ONLY:** By it's nature, this system suggests something many of you like which is player side rolling for everything. If a monster attacks and it has an attack score of 6 (2d6), the GM would say "The ork comes at you! He has an attack score of 6. Roll your dodge and DS 6."

“Dodge2 (d6) + DS6(2d6) = 3d6 vs 6”

| Score | Dice    |
| ----- | ------- |

| 3     | d8      |
| 4     | d10     |
| 5     | d12     |
| 6     | 2d6     |
| 7     | d6+d8   |
| 8     | d6+10   |
| 9     | d6+d12  |
| 10    | 3d6     |
| 11    | 3d6+d8  |
| 12    | 3d6+d10 |
| 13    | 3d6+d12 |
| 14    | 4d6     |
| 15    | 4d6+d8  |
