**WORKING TERMINOLOGY:** **Action Score**: The total of everything working the player's favour. **Difficulty Score**: The total of everything working against the player. **Action Chart**: The little table that shows what dice to roll for each score.

**PLAYER SIDE ROLLS ONLY:** By it's nature, this system suggests something many of you like which is player side rolling for everything. If a monster attacks and it has an attack score of 6 (2d6), the GM would say "The ork comes at you! He has an attack score of 6. Roll your dodge and DS 6."

“Dodge2 (d6) + DS6(2d6) = 3d6 vs 6”
