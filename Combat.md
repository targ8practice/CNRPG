### Health
Broken into two parts, Vitality & Wounds.  Vitality is the small hits you take during combat, easily recoverable.  Wounds are long term effects that will impact your character long after combat is over

Vitality  = Toughness + Strength + Coordination
Wounds = Toughness Score

During combat, when you take damage, remove it from Vitality.  Once your Vitality hits 0, you are knocked unconscious and you take a wound. The only way to recover from a Wound is to take a rest for a period of time and make a Toughness check.  The Difficulty check = 6 + The amount of wounds you want to recover.  Vitality can be recovered after a short rest.  Magical healing will help recover vitality and may contribute towards the action score when recovering from Wounds.  When taking damage, Armor still helps to ignore some of the damage taken
