# Room 1 The Tomb Entrance

>As the heavy doors swing open, the faint light from outside reveals a long chamber with risen platforms on either side. A faded painting of Kassen is on the far wall. The room appears to be the site of a gruesome battle, with two bodies piled in the center and a number of skeletons scattered around. An echoing wail can be heard somewhere in the distance, beyond this foul chamber

This beetle has lived in the dungeon for some time and was recently driven out of its home on the lower level by the undead.

# Area 5 - Shadowy Shapes

> The remains of a small fire smolder in the center of this broad chamber, letting off a plume of oily smoke. Fed by a heap of burning gear, debris, and more than few bones, the fire casts a flickering light across the walls of this room, partially obscured by the veil of smoke

**Hazard** Due to the smoking fire pit and limited ventilation, there is an Environmental Penalty (+1) applied to any check made, this will increase every minute the PC's are in this room until the fire is put out. Once the fire is put out, the smoke dissipates.

There is a malignant creature in this room, a Shadow which won't leave this room as their bones are still here.  Destroying the bones or killing the creature are the only 2 ways to stop it attacking the PCs when they enter the room

**Treasure**
In the fire pit, there's a +1 Dagger and a scorched key

# Area 6 - Key Pool

>In the center of this room is a large pool of clear water, fed by a fountain on the wall above it. The fountain has a stone statue of a weeping maiden holding the slain body of Kassen, but his head has been broken off and is nowhere to be seen. A voice booms out from the darkness, saying, “Magic is the key.” The voice slowly fades, leaving a dreadful silence.

**Environment**
The doors leading out of this room are locked and require a DS 15 check to open. In the bottom of the pool are hundreds of keys. The pool is around 40ft deep.  Whilst underwater, the Difficulty Score to find the right key is 10.  If a player has a focus in Spellcasting, they can make a check DS 5 to spot the key as it radiates magic.  The magic key will unlock the door on the left leading to room 8.  The scorched key will unlock the door to Area 7.

# Area 7 - Room of Reflection
The door leading into this chamber from the north (from area 6) is locked, but it can be opened with the key from area 5 or with a DC 30 Disable Device check. When the PCs enter this chamber, read or paraphrase the following. 

>A small stone bench sits in the center of this dusty chamber. On the far wall is a faded mural depicting the hero Kassen defeating the mercenaries at the entrance to this crypt, with his blade piercing the chest of the mercenary leader. These figures stand alone in the center of a scene of carnage, with dead villagers and mercenaries all around them. 

While the mural in this chamber is meant to show the final battle between Kassen and his foe, the characters might learn of something else if they take time to study the painting. A DC 15 Perception check notices that both Kassen and the mercenary leader are wearing golden necklaces, each made up of a simple golden chain, from which hangs an oddly shaped medallion. While not identical, the amulets look similar

# Room 8 - The Gauntlet

>This long corridor is flanked by a row of human statues, set into alcoves on each side. The statues look like Kassen, and each one holds a longsword out in front of it. The blades of roughly half the statues are wrapped in leather padding. 

This corridor contains a deadly trap that the villagers have taken great pains to diminish. Unfortunately, they were unable to finish their work before the massacre. As a result, the four northernmost statues deal nonlethal damage to anyone they strike, while the southernmost four deal lethal damage. The other leather wrappings for the swords are nowhere to be seen (they were burned in area 5). Trap: There is a pressure plate located between the third pair of statues (marked T on the map). Stepping on this plate causes all of the statues to suddenly swing their swords downward, making attacks against anyone caught between them. Once the trap has been triggered, the swords remain in place, creating a barrier that is difficult to navigate, as creatures must climb over the angled swords. Treat the squares between the northernmost four statues as difficult terrain. Anyone attempting to climb between the southern four statues must make a DC 10 Acrobatics or Escape Artist check to avoid taking 1d4 points of damage from the blades. 

Kassen's Blades  Type mechanical; Perception DC 20; Disable Device DC 20 EFFECTS Trigger location; Reset manual Effect Atk +10 melee (×2) (1d8+1/19–20); multiple targets (all targets between a pair of statues
