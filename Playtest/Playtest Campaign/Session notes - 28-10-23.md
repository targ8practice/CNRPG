# Room 4
*This small chamber is mostly empty, save for the body of a villager sprawled in the center.* Perched atop the corpse is a man-sized brown and yellow beetle, trying to push the corpse into the corner where a pile of trash and filth awaits. This beetle has lived in the dungeon for some time and was recently driven out of its home on the lower level by the undead. Since the attack, it has been feeding well and building a nest in this chamber. Creature: The beetle has become very territorial about this chamber, as it plans to lay eggs soon. It attacks anyone that enters, but does not pursue them out of this chamber
