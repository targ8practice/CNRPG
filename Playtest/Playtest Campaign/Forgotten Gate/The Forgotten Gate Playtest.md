# Overview

>Our tale begins in the heavily wooded foothills of the Donarzheis Mountains. You are a party of intrepid adventurers and have agreed to ascertain whether or not a Deepland entrance still exists and the state of the wards that keep the creatures of darkness locked in the caverns below. If the wards have failed, it is up to you to restore the powerful protective spell that holds the evil at bay.

>Using a copy of an ancient dwarven map (the original, he explains, remains safely back in the archives of the High Temple in New Erinor,) you’ve picked your way through the wilds of Agthor to the place you now stand. Before you, a sheer cliff rises out of the heavy pine forest. 

>Gnarled cliff-pines cling to its face and vines hang from cracks and crevices where they’ve somehow managed to take root. Behind the foliage, you make out the hint of a tower. 

>It is built in the old dwarven architectural style, showing hints of the brutalist aesthetics popular among the dwarves of Malador today, but softer, and bearing more decoration. On further observation, you realize it wasn’t actually constructed, but rather carved directly into the side of the cliff. At the base of the tower is a gaping black hole. Lying on the ground before the hole are the shattered remains of a pair of stone doors.

# Scene 1 - The Tower

The characters are thrown straight into the action! They only have time to perform a single action each before the corrupted plants around the entrance attack. 

#### Exterior 
You stand before a dark tunnel leading into the side of the cliff. Behind the vines and other foliage, you can just make out the old tower. The air is strangely still, and there is a putrid, mulchy scent. At your feet lay the shattered remains of two massive stone doors, partially hidden beneath the leaves and overgrown with vines. 

#### Tower 
Access to the tower and the Deeplands below is by means of the tunnel in the tower’s base. It’s difficult to see very far inside, in part due to the shadows but also because of the vines hanging down over the entrance to the passage. What is clear, however, is that the floors, walls, and ceiling are all worked stone. Carved over the tunnel entrance, unobscured by the vines, is the Old Dwarven word *turjagon*, which means “The Hunter’s Tower.” Despite the tower’s four-story height, there are no upper floors—just false windows and doors looking out over balconies. It’s not clear if there was ever an intent to finish the upper levels or if they were merely for decoration. The architectural style is similar to the blocky, brutalist forms favored by the dwarves of Malador today, but the lines are softer and there is far more decoration. In addition, the pillars and moldings are carved with animals: harts, hares, wolves, foxes, pheasants, and more frolic across the stone, giving a hint of the tower’s original purpose. 

#### Doors 
Examination of the six-inch thick broken stone doors lying in front of the entrance reveal they were battered down from within. The amount of plant growth suggests this occurred many years ago. If the characters ask, the doors are too damaged to hold a ward, even if restored to their original position. 

#### Vines 
The vines and other plants around the entrance have the dark green color of rot, shot through with veins of red and crowned with fleshy bulbs the color of raw meat. Black, sticky sap seeps from the stems and leaves. The sap stains the skin and has a putrid odor. The plants appear otherwise healthy. In fact, the plants, and the vines in particular, are corrupted. A character making a successful DS 6 Intellect action check will realize this. If the character has knowledge of magic, religion, or arcana, they receive +1 AS to this action check Characters with essence sense may detect the corruption with a successful DS 8 Awareness action check, but to do so they must touch the plants with their bare flesh. There is no ambient corruption in the local essence. 

#### Footprints 
There are no footprints leading into or out of the tunnel. The doppelganger hid its tracks after passing through, and the endrori (11) haven’t ventured out yet. 

#### Combat 
Once each character is given a chance to take an action the corrupted vines attack. This assumes there are characters close enough to attack. If not, the vines wait until a character is within reach before launching their attack. 

##### Creatures: 1 corrupted vine 
| Type        | Attack | Defense | Armor | Vitality |
| ----------- | ------ | ------- | ----- | -------- |
| Large Plant | 4      | 6       | 1     | 15       |
###### Abilities - Passive 
* False Appearance - While the awakened vine remains motionless, it looks like a normal plant
* Corrupting Strike - When the vine inflicts a WOUND to its opponent with a Slam or Grab attack, it also inflicts 1 point of corruption on the target
* Mutivine - There are 3 vines, severing one you need to deal 3 damage to it, targeting a Vine is +1DS.
###### Actions
* Slam(Action Score 4(1d10), Melee): The vine slams the target, if it hits, deals an extra 4 damage
* Contrict (Action Score 4, Melee):  The target is Grappled, DS 6 action check to break out.  Start of each turn, target takes 3 damage, 
* Wirthing Mass (Environment) all attacks add +1DS for 1 minute
#### Surprise 
Allow each character to make a **DS 5 Awareness action check.** Characters that succeed notice some telltale movement that warns them of the attack. Those that fail are surprised and may not move or take an action during the first round of combat. 

#### Tactics 
The vines target any living creature in range that is not corrupted or of the dark monster type. They ignore endrori, as well as characters or NPCs (such as the doppelganger) with corruption scores greater than 0. The vines’ goal is to entangle the characters, put them to sleep, and haul them up to the third floor where they can drink their victims’ blood in peace. They only drag characters up if the character is asleep or unconscious. They are not intelligent, and they are easily fooled by characters who play dead. 

#### Treasure 
Lying on the third-floor balcony, not visible from below, is the desiccated corpse of the vines’ last victim, a male human solo adventurer who ran afoul of the tower’s guardians. A successful DS 6 Intellect action check tells the characters the body’s been there at least a few months. Most of his equipment is not worth taking or is damaged beyond repair, but he is carrying the following: 
• 23 cp, 12 sp (Agthorian coins) 
• potion of healing (Restores all Vitality)
• necklace (silver chain with a holy symbol of Aelos on it, also wrought in silver) worth 8 sp
