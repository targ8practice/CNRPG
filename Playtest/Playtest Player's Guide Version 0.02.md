# Cool Name RPG Playtest Players Guide

Welcome to the Cool Name RPG Playtest.  This players guide will assist you in understanding how this game is played.  So without further ado, lets begin!

> **Terminology**
> **Action Check:** Anytime you need to roll dice or compare scores to determine if an action succeeds or fails, we call it a check. 
> **Score:** A numeric value assigned to an ability, item, situation, or anything else that can impact the outcome of a check.
> **Action Score (AS):** The totaled scores for everything working in your character’s favor.
> **Action Table:** The table where you find your Action Score to determine which dice to roll.
> **Action Score Result (ASR)**:  The result after the dice have been rolled and totaled.
> **Difficulty Score(DS):** The totaled scores for everything working against your character.
> **Modus Operandi (MO)**: A representation of your collection of skills, talents, and abilities.
> **Incapacitated:** A condition whereby its difficult for you to make any major actions, communicate or move effectively.  You may be able to take simple actions with your GM's permission. 

# Game Mechanics
To resolve **action checks** in CNRPG, use the steps listed below:
1. The GM will set the difficulty score (anything that works against your characters favour)
2. Find the Action Score, add the scores up that work in the characters favour
3. Roll the dice.  Consult the Action Score Table which will tell you which dice to roll.  *Note: Dice are open ended.*
4. Determine the result.  After the dice have been rolled, add them together to determine the Action Score Result.
5. Compare - If the ASR is equal to or greater than the DS, you have succeeded at the check. 

>Open Ended Dice Rolls
>When you roll the dice, if its maximum value on the dice, roll it again and add it to the total.

## Finding Your Action Score
Action Scores are calculated in the following manner:
**Attribute  + Modus Operandi  + Focus  + Specialisation + Misc. Modifiers = Action Score**

| |Attribute|MO|Focus|Specialisation|Misc|AS|Dice|
|-|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|Athletics|2|3|1|0|0|6|d6+d6|

* Attribute Score - The appropriate attribute for the check
* Modus Operandi Score - Does you MO apply to this check?
* Focus Score - Do you have a focus that would apply?
* Specialisation - Do you have a specialisation that would apply?
* Misc. Modifier is anything that helps the character succeed at the check that they are making.
* Action Score - the score after you add AS, MO, ASM.
* Dice -  Compare the AS on the table to determine what dice to roll.

## Action Score Dice Table

# Character Statistics
## Attributes 
Attributes are broken up into 3 categories: Physical, Mental, Instinctive.

### Physical
#### Strength
This is the character’s ability to lift, carry, pull, push, and cause damage with melee attacks. Strength also reflects the character’s overall muscle mass and physical power.

#### Coordination
The character’s motor skills, sense of balance, agility, and accuracy with ranged weapons are determined by their coordination. It is used for full-body activities such as acrobatics as well as actions requiring hand-eye-coordination, such as pick pocketing.

#### Toughness
Toughness is the ability to function and recover when faced with illness, accidents, or other physical demands. It helps to determine the character’s ability to survive physical injury and resist fatigue.

### Mental
Mind is a representation of the character’s willpower, intellect, and creativity. It impacts the character’s ability to solve problems, recall information, and resist mental manipulation.
#### Creativity
Creativity represents the character’s ability to assemble information in new and novel ways. It is core attribute for artistic creation, thinking “outside of the box,” and finding solving problems where the answer lies outside the realm of accepted truths.
#### Intellect
A character’s logical processing, ability to identify patterns, and general memory are all aspects of their intellect. Intellect is the key attribute for action checks involving logical deduction, learning complex tasks, and remembering facts.
#### Willpower
Willpower is the character’s ability to resist the influence of others and persevere in the face of extreme hardship. Willpower is important for resisting fear, combating psychic assault, and seeing through illusions
### Instinctive 
Spirit reflects the character’s empathy, presence, and awareness. It also represents the character’s inherent wisdom, force of personality, ability to quickly process sensory information, and retain their composure in stressful situations. 
#### Awareness
A character’s Awareness is their ability to notice key details in their surroundings. Awareness comes into play when trying to finding hidden objects, spotting unusual features of a place or object, and seeing through deception.
#### Empathy
A character’s Empathy represents how in touch they are with other living creatures and, in some settings, the natural world. Empathy might come into play when trying to bond with or train an animal, engender trust in a person or group, or recognizing a person’s true intentions and nature
#### Presence
Presence represents a character’s force of personality. The skills it applies to are learned, but the attribute represents the character’s natural “stage presence.” Action checks for performance, intimidation, seduction, and leadership are all examples of action checks influenced by the character’s presence. Note that presence is not necessarily “charisma.” A hideous monster is just as likely to have a high presence as a dashing rogue


**Typical Attribute Scores**

| Score | Example             |
| ----- |:------------------- |
| 1     | Children, Elderly   |
| 2     | Average Person      |
| 3     | Notably better      |
| 4     | Exceptional ability |
| 5     | World Class         |

**Starting Attributes**
For our play-test, if you want to make your own character, you will begin with the following attribute scores: **2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4**. Assign one of these numbers to each of your attributes.

## Secondary Attributes
Characters have a number of secondary attributes that will come into play during the game, especially during combat. 
### Vitality Threshold
A character’s Vitality Threshold represents how long they can stay on their feet and keep fighting. It is a combination of the character’s overall health, their resistance to stunning blows, and their ability to resist fatigue. Whenever the character strains themselves, takes a hit, or otherwise suffers physical injury,  add it to your Vitality, When a character’s current Vitality reaches the Vitality Threshold, the character is Incapacitated and can't take any major actions during combat. The Vitality Threshold is the total of all the character’s physical attribute scores. **Strength score + Toughness score + Coordination score = Maximum Vitality score**

### Wound Threshold
A character’s Wound Threshold is equal to their **Toughness score**. Whenever a character takes damage equal to or greater than their Wound Threshold in a single hit, they get a wound. Each untreated wound adds +1 to the DS for all action checks. (See Vitality, Wounds, and Healing in the Combat section for more information.)
### Initiative
Initiative represents the characters awareness and reflex before combat begins and determines the order in which players take their turn when combat starts.  Initiative is equal to their **Coordination score + Awareness score**.
## Modus Operandi

Each character has one or more Modus Operandi (MOs). Each MO represents a collection of skills, talents, and abilities the character picked-up during their career as an adventurer. When faced with a challenge, it is up to you and the GM to determine if your MO score applies to the situation at hand. MOs have scores, just like attributes. For this playtest, the scores for your character’s MOs will range from 1 to 3. When resolving a check where your MO applies, add your MO score to your Attribute score to determine your Action Score.  

**Starting MOs**

You have 3 points to assign to MOs when creating a playtest character. You can either have:
* One MO with a score of 3.
* One MO with a score of 2 and a second MO with a score of 1.

The first MO you choose will be the Primary MO.  This is the MO from which you gain your **Special Feature** 

## Focus & Specialisation
Your MO represents a broad collection of skills, talents, and abilities your character has mastered, but it’s possible to spend extra time perfecting one’s skills in a particular area. In Cool Name RPG, we represent this with Focuses and Specializations. 
#### Focuses (Foci??) 
A focus represents extra time spent by the character improving a single, broad area of study related to an MO. For instance, a warrior might have a focus in Melee Combat or a Thief might have a focus in Deception. 
##### Focuses and Action Checks 
Whenever your character performs an action check, it is up to the player and the GM to determine if one of the character’s focuses applies in that situation. If it does, the player may add the scores for both the Focus and the related MO to their Action Score for that action check.
##### Choosing Focuses 
The description of each MO lists the focuses a character can select for that MO. If you and the GM think of an equally logical focus of your own, however, you are welcome to add a focus not included on the list. 
##### Starting Focuses 
For the purpose of this playtest, your get 2 points to assign to focuses. You can distribute these in any way you like. You must have a minimum score of 1 in the parent MO to put points into a focus.

#### Specializations 
So your character has the Warrior MO with a focus in Melee, but what if you want the character to be a master of the sword? In other words, they can use most melee weapons, but they are at their finest when wielding a blade. In that case, you would want to add a specialization to your character’s focus. Specializations represent a further refinement of the character’s skills. Where a focus is a refinement of the MO, a specialization is a refinement of the focus. 
##### Specializations and Action Checks 
Whenever your character performs an action check, it is up to the player and the GM to determine if one of the character’s specializations apply in that situation. If it does, the player may add the scores for the Specialization, the Focus, and the related MO to their Action Score for that action check. 
##### Choosing Specializations 
The description of each MO lists the specializations a character can select for that MO. If you and the GM think of an equally logical specialization of your own, however, you are welcome to add a specialization not included on the list. 
##### Starting Specializations 
For the purpose of this playtest, your get 1 point to assign to a specialization. You must have a minimum score of 1 in the parent focus to put points into a specialization

#### List of Focuses & Specializations
Below is a list of the current foci and their specialisations

## List of MOs
Below is a list of Modus Operandi that you can choose from.
### Cleric
Clerics are warrior priests. It is their duty to see that the will and rule of the gods are carried out and obeyed. They are religious specialists with extensive knowledge of their god and how that god is worshiped. They are also trained in the arts of combat, since their duties often take them into hostile territory or place them in situations where they are expected to defeat the enemies of their god. It is also likely that they can wield magic in some capacity, giving them access to spells
related to the powers and domains of their deity. Finally, they receive training in the healing arts, often serving as battlefield medics. 
**Suggested Foci:** Divine, Religion Lore, Combat (Defence), Healing
### Merchant
Merchants are professional traders. Some travel from town to town while others sell their wares in permanent shops. They are expert hagglers, decent performers, and know how to quickly make friendly social connections with strangers. They are not warriors, but they know how to wield most light and simple weapons, since they may need to face off against bandits or thieves to defend their livelihood.
**Suggested Foci:** Persuasion, Deception, Performance, Professional

### Ranger
Rangers are warders of the forest, skilled in wilderness survival, overland navigation, and wood-lore. They have an affinity for the wild creatures of the world, and they love and respect nature. They are both hunter and protector of wild creatures, and are unmatched as trackers. Nature is nurturing, but also unforgiving and violent, so Rangers have mastered the use of bows, light weapons, and light armor.
**Suggested Foci:** Nature Lore, Hunt, Ranged, Endurance
### Sage
Sages are professional academics. They are the learned keepers of knowledge, versed in everything from history to  chemistry. The library is their home, but they have picked up a few survival skills in their occasional forays out into the world to obtain first-hand knowledge of their areas of interest. They are poor warriors, and while they know how to do many things, they often lack the practical skills to execute on their knowledge.
**Suggested Foci:** Leadership, Alchemy, Science, Art
### Survivalist
A survivalist is at home in all the wild places of the world. Mountain or marsh, forest of fen, the survivalist knows where to find food, water, and shelter in any wild place. They are decent hunters and trappers, skilled in the preparation of herbal remedies, and are fair combatants 
**Suggested Foci** Nature Lore, Journey, Camping, Hunt

### Thief
The thief’s goal in life is to get rich by taking wealth from others. Although it is a simple goal, it is also one rife with complications—specifically, the original owners of said wealth want to keep it. To get around this, thieves are experts at stealth, subterfuge, and infiltration. They have also learned to spot, disarm, and set traps as needed. Climbing, squeezing, and balancing also play a key role in their work. They can engage in direct combat if needed, but are more suited to hit and run actions.
**Suggested Foci:** Deception, Larceny, Stealth, Security
### Warrior
Warriors are trained for one mission—to defeat the enemy in battle! They engage enemies head on, steel against steel. They are skilled in the use of all manner of melee and ranged weapons, from simple clubs to the finest blades to bows and crossbows. Warriors are also trained to survive in the field. They can make camp, forage for food, and set up simple defences. Field medicine is another of their talents, and to ensure their fitness for battle, they train in all manner of athletic activities.
**Suggested Foci:** Melee, Ranged, Defence, Unarmed

### Wizard
Masters of the arcane arts, wizards are powerful spellcasters and keepers of forbidden lore. They are privy to the metaphysical secrets of the universe and the magical forces at play in the world. They have knowledge of magical and magically altered beasts, basic skills in alchemy, and can sense the presence of magic and possibly identify its nature. 
**Suggested Foci:** Spellcasting (Arcane), Enchanting, Alchemy, Arcana

## Combat 
This is the playtest rules for combat.
### Rounds & Turns
Cool Name RPG tracks time in combat using Rounds and Turns. Each Round of combat every participant in the combat gets one Turn to act. Combatants act in the order of their initiative scores, with the highest initiative score going first, the next highest second, and so forth.
### Movement
Each player will be able to move their character up to 30ft during their turn
### Actions per Round
For the purpose of this playtest, characters can take one major action, one movement, and one minor action per Round. Minor actions include changing position, drawing a blade, moving a short distance, or throwing open a door. Major actions include casting a spell, attacking an enemy, or retrieving something from your backpack. As a general rule, if it requires an action check, it’s a major action.  Movement actions are generally considered to be when the character moves around the battlefield.
### Initiative
At the start of a combat encounter, each player makes a Coordination action check for their character. There is no DS for this action check. Warriors may add their Warrior MO score to their Action Score for the Initiative action check. Characters with other MOs only add their MO score if the GM agrees it is appropriate. The total rolled is the character’s initiative score. The initiative score for NPCs and monsters is already listed in their stats. No dice are rolled. 

#### Changing Your Initiative 
If a player wants to reroll their character’s initiative, they may use the character’s turn to roll a new initiative score. The character may take no other actions on that turn. Whatever the player rolls, even if it is lower than their original initiative, becomes the character’s initiative starting on the next round. 
#### Ready 
On their character’s turn, a player may declare a Ready for their character. With a Ready, the character prepares to take a specific action if a specific event occurs. When the event occurs, the character may immediately take their declared action. Taking a Ready does not change the character’s initiative score. If the character does not use their Ready that round, they may hold it over into the following round, but whenever they take their action, it counts as their turn for that round. After taking (or dropping) their readied action, in future rounds the character acts on their previously rolled initiative score. Taking a Ready allows the character to go after the trigger event occurs but before any other actions take place. The character is effectively interrupting the declared event. If the declared event never occurs, or if the character chooses not to use the specified action, the character loses their action for that round
#### Delay 
On their character’s turn, a player can declare a Dealy for their character. With a Delay, the character may take their turn later in the round. When the player wishes to end the character’s Delay, they announce that the character is taking their Delayed turn. At this point the character may take any action the player likes, but the character acts after any other characters or monsters taking a turn on that Initiative score. Taking a Delay does not change the character’s Initiative score. If the delay is held over until the next round, they may take the Delayed turn at any time in the new round, but they still only get one turn in the round

### Attacking the Enemy
To attack an enemy, the player makes a Coordination based action check for their character against a DS equal to the Defence score of the enemy. This is true for both ranged and melee attacks. 
#### MOs and Attack Action Scores 
Every character knows how to fight with fists, feet, daggers, and clubs. If the character is using one of these weapons, the player may add any one of the character’s MO scores to their attack Action Score. Characters with the Warrior MO may add their Warrior MO score to all attack Action Scores, regardless of the weapon they are wielding. With the GM’s permission, a character with a non- Warrior MO who is wielding a weapon appropriate to their MO may add their MO score to their attack Action Score. For example, the GM might allow a character to add their Thief MO score to their Action Score if the thief is attacking with a hand crossbow. Hand crossbow is not specifically called out in the MO description or in the information above, but it is a logical weapon for a thief to use
#### Focus & Specialisation
If you have the appropriate Focus & Specialisation for the weapon you are wielding, you can add this to your action check.

#### Attack Difficulty Score
Every monster and NPC will have a Defence Score.  This score serves as the DS for the action check when attacking that monster or NPC.

#### Damage
If the character hits, the base damage inflicted is equal to the difference between the number rolled and the Difficulty Score. Modify the base damage as follows: 
*  Add the character’s Strength score to the damage for melee attacks. 
*  If the weapon has a Damage score, add this score to the damage. 
*  If the monster has an Armor score, reduce the damage by the monster’s Armor score. Once you determine the total damage, reduce the monster’s Vitality by that amount. If the monster’s Vitality reaches zero, they are defeated
#### Defending
When you are being attacked, make an action check, adding the appropriate Attribute, Focus & Specialisation.  You also add your MO to this check because it's assumed that all characters have some level of training in defending themselves.  If the result is less than the Difficulty Score, you take damage equal to the difference.  If you are wearing Armor, reduce the damage taken by this amount.  When defending you can defend using one of the following options:

* Dodge - The default defending option, you use your Coordination Attribute + MO + Defense Focus + Dodge specialisation.  You must also have 5ft free around you at the time.
* Block - Raise you shield, you can block the incoming attack.  Use your Toughness Attribute + MO + Defense Focus + Block Specialisation.
* Parry - Readying your weaponry, You can parry an incoming attack. Use your Strength attribute + MO + Defense Focus + Parry specialisation.

#### Armor
Reduces the amount of damage you take.
### Vitality, Wounds & Healing
#### Vitality 
When a character’s Vitality reaches the Vitality Threshold, they are incapacitated. They remain incapacitated until they are below the Vitality Threshold. While incapacitated,  the character cannot  make any Action Checks (Except for Dodge when defending). If a character takes damage while incapacitated, they automatically suffer a wound. If the damage is less than the character’s Toughness score, the wound has a severity of one. Otherwise, the wound’s severity is calculated normally (see Wounds below). 
#### Recovering Vitality 
There are a few ways to recover vitality. 
##### Recovery Action 
On their Turn, a character may take a Recovery action. When taking a Recovery action (which is considered a Major Action), the character makes a Toughness action check for their character with a Difficulty Score equal to the total of the severity scores for untreated wounds. On a success, the character reduces their  Vitality Score by the amount you succeed by.  
##### First Aid 
If a character is unconscious, another character may perform an Intellect action check to perform first aid. The Base DS for this check is zero, but wounds and other effects may modify the DS. On a success,  the character reduces their  Vitality Score by the amount you succeed by. Modifiers may apply. No special conditions or materials are necessary for this action check, but especially dangerous, stressful, or bad conditions might increase the DS. 
##### Rest 
An hour of uninterrupted rest reduces their Vitality Score back to zero

#### Wounds 
Anytime the character takes damage equal to or greater than their **Toughness attribute**, they gain a wound. Each wound has a severity score. The severity is based on the number of times the wound exceeded your Toughness score.
##### Wound Effects 
Each untreated wound increases the Difficulty Score for all action checks by +1, regardless of severity. Each untreated wound also increases the Action Score for monster attacks by +1
##### Treating Wounds 
A treated wound has no impact on the DS’s for the character’s action checks. To treat a wound, a character must perform first aid by making an Intellect action check. The Base DS for this action check is 3. The Base DS assumes the characters are in a safe location and have a well-stocked first aid or healing kit are requirements. The wound the character is treating, along with any other untreated wounds, modify the DS as described under Wound Effects. A dangerous environment, lack of the right medical equipment, and other detrimental effects will modify the DS as well. A character may treat their own wounds, but this adds +1 to the DS. Treated wounds only remain treated until the next morning. At that point the wound must be treated again or the character begins suffering the effects of the wound severity on their DS. 
##### Healing Wounds 
Healing wounds naturally is a slow process. The character must spend a full week resting in a safe, clean location, undertaking no more than light physical activity. At the end of each week, the character makes a Toughness action check with a DS equal to the total of the wound severities for all their wounds. On a success, the character reduces the severity of all their wounds by 1 point. Any wounds reduced to zero are considered fully healed and removed from the character’s character sheet.
#### Death and Dying 
A character cannot die from Vitality loss, but each time the character takes a wound they must make a Toughness action check. The DS of the action check is the severity of all the character’s current wounds, treated or untreated. On a successful check, the character survives the wound and has no additional effects. On a failure, the character collapses to the ground and is dying
##### Dying 
A dying character is unconscious with their life slowly ebbing away. The character will continue dying for a number of Rounds equal to their Toughness score. On the Round after that, the character dies.
##### Stabilization 
Another character can stabilize a dying character by making an Intellect action check against a DS equal to the total severity of all the character’s wounds, treated or untreated. On a success, the character being treated stops dying, but remains out cold for the remainder of the encounter. At the end of the encounter, they regain consciousness and may continue their adventure. A failure does not make things any worse, but the character keeps dying.
