## Overview

This rules module focuses on creating special features that you can attach to a particular Modus Operandi (MO).  When a player chooses a MO for their character, they will also get this Special Feature. If however they choose multiple MO’s, they can only choose to have ONE of the Special Features.
### Terminology 
- ASR - Action Score Result
- DS - Difficulty Score
- MO - Modus Operandi
### Spellcasting (Cleric or Wizard)
You have either arcane gifts or a connection to a deity that grants you the ability to cast spells. You have the ability to cast the following spells:
- Force missile - Deal damage equal to the difference between DS and ASR 
- Healing Touch - Restore health equal to the difference between DS and ASR
- Force Armor - gain +3 armour rating for the duration of combat.

When casting these spells, you make a Spellcasting check (DS 6) and expend a spell point. You have X spell points equal to your casting attribute (Spirit or Mind). These recharge after a long rest.

### Exploit Weakness (Thief)
When you surprise a target or you're attacking the same target as another player, you add +1 to your damage.
### Weapons Expert (Warrior)
You are excellent at weapons work, gain +1 AS when you attack with a weapon.
### Know It All (Sage)
Your esoteric knowledge about a lot of subjects means you can add your MO to any skill-related check.
