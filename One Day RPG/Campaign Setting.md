# Shattered Sky

Shattered world, held together by a central pillar known as the prime lodestone. People live on floating islands that orbit the lodestone  
  
Aethermacers sense the magic currents and channel them

Often referred to as the Cataclysm, the world was shattered and no one knows how but instead of the world obliterating, it was held together by great sacrifice that allowed the land to form into floating islands that orbit around a central pillar known as the Prime Lodestone.  


"Shattered Skies: Season 1 An RPG experience going over 5 week with players going on a grand adventure to stop the world from getting sucked into the void."

It will be a 5 week programme (this can be tweaked if needed) using the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition ruleset set in a world of my own creation (Steampunk,  Magi-tech, Floating islands, sky pirates are just some of the inspirations for this world). Each 3 hour session is a single adventure but will still tie into the main narrative arc.  The reason for this if players miss sessions, they can still catch up without feeling like they've missed anything.  These single adventures will culminate in a grand finale.
