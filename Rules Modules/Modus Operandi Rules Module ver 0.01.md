## Modus Operandi Special Features Rules Module

This rules module focuses on creating special features that you can attach to a particular Modus Operandi (MO). When a player chooses a MO for their character, they will also get this Special Feature. If however they choose multiple MO’s, the Primary MO will be the one to gain the related special feature.

* Dancing Lights (DS 3) -  you have 4 small lights appear around you for the duration of combat, you can command these lights to hover where you like.
* Force Armor (DS 4) - gain +1 armour rating for the duration of combat.
### Spiritual Persuasion
You have a spiritual connection to a deity or local spirit and you're able to persuade them to grant you spells. The spell casting focus is Divine and you use Presence as your casting attribute

* Heal (DS 6) - Restore health equal to the difference between DS and ASR
* Protective Ward (DS 4) - Gain +1 armour rating for the duration of combat
* Bless (DS 4)- Grant the target a +1 to the next Action check they make.

>**Spell casting** 
>
>You have either arcane gifts or a connection to a deity that grants you the ability to cast spells. When casting spells, you make an Action Check (Casting Attribute + Modus Operandi + Focus). If you don't have any points in a Spellcasting focus, it will cost you a point in Vitality to attempt to cast a spell. Be warned though, failure to pass the check may result in a negative consequence rather than a positive one.

### Exploit Weakness
When you surprise a target or you're attacking the same target that's engaged with another player, add +1 to damage rolls.
### Combat Ready
You excel in the art of combat, Add your Modus Operandi to all offensive, defensive and Initiative action checks.
### Know It All
Your esoteric knowledge about a lot of subjects means you can convey this knowledge to other characters.  As an Action, you make a Difficulty Score 6 check (You action score is Intelligence + MO+ focus) to assist a character in a task. If you pass the check, you grant them a +1 to their Action Score.  But if you fail the roll, the Difficulty Score of the check increases by 1 instead.  
### Be Prepared
You always know what to bring or have with you.  Once per session, you have exactly what you need (GM Discretion applies though)
### Primal Affinity
You can use your Instinctive Attributes to communicate with animals. This doesn’t mean you can talk to them but you can interpret their actions.
### Silver Tongue
You know how to get the best deal out of any situation, Add +1 AS when selling or buying goods.
