Using magic in Cool Name RPG is not as simple as waving your hands and saying a few magic words. It requires skill, knowledge and strength of will in order to produce magical effects. There are 2 sources of power which characters can access in order to cast spells, Divine and Arcane. Whilst they can both produce the same effects, it's the how that makes them different. Casting a spell is considered a Major Action and requires an Action Check to succeed. When attempting to cast a spell, you must first decide on what you want the spell or prayer to do. Naturally there are spellbooks and prayer scrolls which make this a lot easier to determine.

Casting a spell or Praying to the divine incurs a cost to the cast in the form of Strain. This represents the effort taken to concentrate and produce the necessary effect.

Mechanics when casting:

Action Score = Attribute + Modus Operandi + Focus + Specialization + Misc.

Difficulty Score = Base Difficulty score + Spell effects + Strain Total + Misc

**Attribute** Use Intellect for Arcane, Persuasion for Divine **Strain Total** When you cast a spell, you add your current Strain and the Strain of the spell you want to cast. **Strain** How much effort it takes to cast the spell

Spell example

**Healing** - Restores a number of Vitality points to the target equal to the Result Difference. Strain 2, Range touch.

**Bolt** - Single target bolt of force, dealing damage to the target equal to the Result Difference. Strain 2, Range 30ft

**Boost Action Score/Difficulty Score** - Target either gains a bonus to their Action score or Difficulty Score equal to the Result Difference / 2. Strain 3, Range <=30ft. Duration = Encounter

**Armor** - Target gains a bonus to their Armor equal to the Result Difference / 3. Strain 2, Range touch. Duration = encounter.

If you fail the roll, the spell doesn't work. But if you fail the roll by 5 or more... negative effects could happen.
