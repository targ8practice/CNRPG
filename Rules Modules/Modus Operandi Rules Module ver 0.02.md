## List of MOs
Below is a list of Modus Operandi that you can choose from.
### Cleric
Clerics are warrior priests. It is their duty to see that the will and rule of the gods are carried out and obeyed. They are religious specialists with extensive knowledge of their god and how that god is worshiped. They are also trained in the arts of combat, since their duties often take them into hostile territory or place them in situations where they are expected to defeat the enemies of their god. It is also likely that they can wield magic in some capacity, giving them access to spells
related to the powers and domains of their deity. Finally, they receive training in the healing arts, often serving as battlefield medics. 
**Special Feature:** Spiritual Persuasion
**Suggested Foci:** Spellcasting(Divine), Healing, Religion, Defence
### Merchant
Merchants are professional traders. Some travel from town to town while others sell their wares in permanent shops. They are expert hagglers, decent performers, and know how to quickly make friendly social connections with strangers. They are not warriors, but they know how to wield most light and simple weapons, since they may need to face off against bandits or thieves to defend their livelihood.
**Special Feature:** Silver Tongue
**Suggested Foci:** Persuasion, Deception, Performance, Professional

### Ranger
Rangers are warders of the forest, skilled in wilderness survival, overland navigation, and wood-lore. They have an affinity for the wild creatures of the world, and they love and respect nature. They are both hunter and protector of wild creatures, and are unmatched as trackers. Nature is nurturing, but also unforgiving and violent, so Rangers have mastered the use of bows, light weapons, and light armor.
**Special Feature:** Primal Affinity
**Suggested Foci:** Nature Lore, Hunt, Ranged, Endurance
### Sage
Sages are professional academics. They are the learned keepers of knowledge, versed in everything from history to  chemistry. The library is their home, but they have picked up a few survival skills in their occasional forays out into the world to obtain first-hand knowledge of their areas of interest. They are poor warriors, and while they know how to do many things, they often lack the practical skills to execute on their knowledge.
**Special Feature:** Know it all
**Suggested Foci:** Leadership, Alchemy, Science, Art
### Survivalist
A survivalist is at home in all the wild places of the world. Mountain or marsh, forest of fen, the survivalist knows where to find food, water, and shelter in any wild place. They are decent hunters and trappers, skilled in the preparation of herbal remedies, and are fair combatants 
**Special Feature:** Prepper
**Suggested Foci** Nature Lore, Journey, Camping, Hunt

### Thief
The thief’s goal in life is to get rich by taking wealth from others. Although it is a simple goal, it is also one rife with complications—specifically, the original owners of said wealth want to keep it. To get around this, thieves are experts at stealth, subterfuge, and infiltration. They have also learned to spot, disarm, and set traps as needed. Climbing, squeezing, and balancing also play a key role in their work. They can engage in direct combat if needed, but are more suited to hit and run actions.
**Special Feature:** Exploit Weakness
**Suggested Foci:** Deception, Larceny, Stealth, Security
### Warrior
Warriors are trained for one mission—to defeat the enemy in battle! They engage enemies head on, steel against steel. They are skilled in the use of all manner of melee and ranged weapons, from simple clubs to the finest blades to bows and crossbows. Warriors are also trained to survive in the field. They can make camp, forage for food, and set up simple defences. Field medicine is another of their talents, and to ensure their fitness for battle, they train in all manner of athletic activities.
**Special Feature:** Weapons Expert
**Suggested Foci:** Melee, Ranged, Defence, Unarmed
### Wizard
Masters of the arcane arts, wizards are powerful spellcasters and keepers of forbidden lore. They are privy to the metaphysical secrets of the universe and the magical forces at play in the world. They have knowledge of magical and magically altered beasts, basic skills in alchemy, and can sense the presence of magic and possibly identify its nature. 
**Special Feature:** Arcane Power
**Suggested Foci:** Spellcating(Arcane), Enchanting, Alchemy, Arcana
